## YOLO and OpenCV for Energy Saving via Object Detection.
The main objective of this project is to save energy by automation of appliances. The allows switching on and off fan control according to human. Fan will be turned on when a human enters the room. Fan will be turned off when humans leave the room. Temperature information will be displayed in a LED screen. Temperature sensor (LM35) will sense the room temperature. Image processing is used to detect the people who are entering or leaving the room .It allows to sense motion, almost always used to detect whether a human has moved in or out of the room. The fan is turned on only the zone where a human is detected and the fans in other zones are turned off.

Fans usually provide two options for directing airflow:
1. The fan is static and needs to be physically redirected to direct air in the desired direction.
2. The fan can rotate back and forth at a set angle which is approximately 180 degrees.
We can solve these daily stresses and inconveniences of fan use by automating the process based 
on the user presence inside room, which will be identified using image processing.
